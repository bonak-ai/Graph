# StudentsGrade using graph

This is a StudentsGrade console application designed to display student grades in a visually intuitive format using a text-based bar graph. This program allows the user to input the names and grades of multiple students and then presents a graphical representation of each student's grade. Each bar corresponds to a percentage of the student's score, making it easy to compare their performance.

# what it can do:

1. Input Flexibility: Users can input any number of students, along with their respective grades.
